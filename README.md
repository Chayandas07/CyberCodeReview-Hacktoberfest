# Easy Cyber Scripts

- There are cyber security scritps (basic yet useful)
- Each script is located in different folder - based on their usage 
- For example, Port Scanner folder has a simple python script to conduct port scan
- All you need to do is to review the script source code
- Each script has some minor error
- You have to execute the script and idenify the error 
- Once you identify the error you have to create a PR for the same
- The changes will be tracked by the maintainers 
- Once you PR is approved - you will be listed automatically in the shiny amazing crazy **CONTRIBUTORS** list ðŸ˜Ž
