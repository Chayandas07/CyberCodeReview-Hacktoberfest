# CyberCodeReview-Hacktoberfest
> Fellow contributors -We are open and welcome for your PRs ðŸš€

This repo contains some simple (yet useful) cyber security scripts developed in different languages (C++, Python etc.) Each and every code is located in their respective folders based on their use and purpose. 

For example - Port Scanner folder has a simple python script that can be used to scan ports on a network.

**RULES!**
- You have to perform **CODE REVIEW** on these scripts
- Each script will have some minor error which will result in failure
- All you need to do is review the script (by executing it and finding the error)
- Once you identify an error - You have to create Pull Request for the same. 
- Maintainers will review your PR and if its accepted - There you go to the awesome crazy list of **Contributors** ðŸ˜Ž
